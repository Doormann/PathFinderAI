Here is the command to train the model: yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
Here is the command to run the model: yolo task=detect mode=predict model='runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt' source='path/to/some/new_image.jpg'

What is being used:
## Core Programming & Machine Learning

    Python: The primary programming language used for all the scripts.

    TensorFlow: The underlying deep learning framework that powers both the initial Keras model and the final YOLOv8 model.

    Keras: The high-level API you initially used to load and interact with your image classification model from Teachable Machine.

    YOLOv8 (ultralytics library): The powerful object detection framework you are now using to train your custom footprint detector.

## Image & Data Handling

    Pillow (PIL): A key library used to open, resize, and handle image files in your Python scripts.

    NumPy: The fundamental library for numerical operations in Python, used for handling images as arrays of numbers.

    OpenCV (opencv-python): Used for advanced image processing, specifically for creating and overlaying the Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations.

## External Annotation Tools

    LabelImg: The standalone desktop application you are using to draw bounding boxes on your images and create the .txt annotation files for training.

    CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool): The more advanced, browser-based tool that was mentioned as a powerful alternative to LabelImg for larger projects.

## GUI & Dependencies

    Tkinter: Python's built-in library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). We used it to create the file selection dialog window.

    PyQt5: A GUI framework that LabelImg is built on. We had to manage its specific version to resolve the error when drawing bounding boxes


    Update 08/11/2025:
    Need more data, model is starting to overfit.
	Think about adding a track-line detection class.
